Every program starts with three open connections:
- stdin
- stdout
- stderr
They are just byte streams provided by the OS
By running this:
println!("hello");
You are not printing to the screen.
You are writin bytes to the file descriptor.


Buffering:
Writing to the OS is expensive. Writing one byte at a time is slow.

Instead of writing immediately, they:
- Collect data in memory (buffer)
- Send it to the OS in chunks

This is buffering.

Types of buffering:
- unbuffered
- line-buffered
- fully-buffered


Stop thinking:
- “My program prints and reads”
Start thinking:
- “My program exchanges bytes with streams controlled by the OS”


TTY: Teletype (historical name, still used)
Today it means:
“An interactive terminal device controlled by a human”
Examples:
- Your terminal window
- SSH session
- Linux virtual console
Not a TTY:
- Redirected output (> file.txt)
- A pipe (| another_program)
- A log file


It forces any buffered output to be wrotten to the terminal immediately:
std::io::stdout().flush().unwrap();

std::io::stdout()
Returns a handle to the process’s standard output.
Important detail you probably gloss over: this is buffered, usually line-buffered when attached to a TTY and fully buffered when redirected to a file or pipe.
Translation: printing doesn’t necessarily show up right away.
